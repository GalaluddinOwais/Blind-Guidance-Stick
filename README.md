# About the project
#### This project provides a device in the form of a stick designed to assist visually impaired individuals in gaining awareness of their surroundings and guiding them during their daily navigation. It accomplishes this by issuing audio warnings about obstacles or gaps detected in front of the user and, upon request, by describing the spatial situation in audio format to help wayfinding.

# Key Achievements
* Utilized Arduino Uno and its integrated development environment to build the embedded system.
* Designed a stick with hands-free speakers, forward-facing sonar capable of rotating, and another down-ward facing sonar attached to
* Enabled the speakers to issue warnings to the user about danger in front of or beneath them and to provide surrounding distance information using the rotating sonar.

# Requirements
 `Arduino IDE`
 `Talkie library`

# Execution
* Collect and connect the hardware components as per the image below

* Open the Arduino IDE

* Install Talkie library if not already installed
  
  ("Sketch" ➔ "Include Library" ➔ "Manage Libraries" ➔ type "Talkie" in the search bar ➔ Locate Talkie library and "Install")

* Open the source code in the Arduino IDE

* Connect the Arduino board to your computer (via USB)

* Burn the code to the Arduino board
  
  (by clicking on "Upload" button with the right arrow symbol "➔")
